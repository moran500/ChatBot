I hope they do just because I love trades. Makes everything so much more interesting.
I'd feel pretty bad if I went this long and called it quits with yellow too.
Could they at least not let him out of the country if he was a suspect?

This is almost too surreal, why wouldn't they give at least 24 hour notice for us to copy our song titles from our collections???
